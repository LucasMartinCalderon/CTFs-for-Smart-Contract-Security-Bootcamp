# Advanced Space Zoo CTF Challenge

## Overview

Dive into the depths of Ethereum smart contract storage with the Advanced Space Zoo CTF Challenge. This challenge is designed for those looking to deepen their understanding of Solidity's storage mechanisms and how they can be exploited to access private data.

## Objective

Your mission is to reveal the secret feeding schedules of the mystical creatures protected by the Advanced Space Zoo. These schedules are hidden away in the smart contract's storage, deemed inaccessible. But are they really?

## The Challenge

Solidity contracts store data in a linear, predictable manner. This challenge invites you to exploit this predictability to access the "private" feeding schedules of the Space Zoo's inhabitants.

## Instructions

### Setting Up in Remix IDE

1. **Open Remix IDE:** Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) in your web browser.

2. **Create Contracts:**
   - Create a new file named `AdvancedSpaceZoo.sol` and paste the provided AdvancedSpaceZoo contract code.
   - Create another new file named `AdvancedSpacePoacher.sol` and paste the provided AdvancedSpacePoacher contract code.

3. **Compile the Contracts:** Use the Solidity Compiler in Remix to compile both
